# house-of-cards-1998
A tech veteran’s quiet exit from a broken tech industry; infrastructure built, ideals lost, truth logged.


In 1996 jwgv published his first webpage, focused on amateur astronomy. He then worked at a tech startup company that was later acquired by a famous tech mogul. By 1999 he was working for a major dot-com company, debugging mod-perl scripts sometimes at 3 a.m. He went on to survive the dot-com crash, helping to build Web 2.0 from its ashes. He built cloud infrastructure from scratch, operationalizing the CDN tooling commonly used today. He went on to build enterprise-scale web apps, microservices, workflow automations and AI tools.



During his tenure he watched the industry's culture change: from tinkering hackers to bean counter sprint cycles. Innovation was replaced by inclusion theater. Meritocracy was rejected, discouraged. Corporate buzzwords became the prevalent language. He quietly coded through the rise of Big Tech: Amazon, Facebook, Google, watching his American peers laid off in waves while H-1Bs were flown into his community like a swarm of locust descending on the crops. Twice laid off, he was required to train his H-1B replacements before being discarded.


After working remotely for 15 years, he endured the RTO mandates in 2024, enforced not for "collaboration", rather for optics. His commute became 3+ hours of soul crushing traffic. His vacation accrual was seized by the tech oligarchs, replaced with "unlimited" time off which he could never utilize, instead covering while his H-1B teammates cycled out for their month-long retreats back to their countries. They said, going home for less than a month was hardly worth it. Being a top performer, jwgv found himself lectured by H-1Bs to slow down and do less. His H-1B manager gave him a nudge toward the door. As the only American left in a team of H-1Bs and offshores, he was no longer a good "culture fit".



Jvgw left exhausted, tired of the performative DEI trainings where technical skill was sidelined. He was equally tired of "genius" H-1B managers who couldn’t write a program to save their life. He was tired of watching the world's richest companies routinely fire experienced American engineers, while begging Congress for more H-1B visas, claiming a "talent shortage”.



So he gave his two weeks notice and left. No drama, no farewell email, no crash out video.



Jwgv now lives in a rural community in California where his family has lived for five generations, near the long country road named after his great grandfather's family.  He occasionally checks tech news out of habit, not hope. He sees more and more H-1Bs and their families walking down his great grandfather’s road, wearing their tech swag. Some publically urinate as they patrol his family's long time home.  He wonders why they don't live and work in their own country, near places named after their ancestors.

It won't last. The internet is being mismanaged by people who never built anything that lasted. The average Big Tech tenure is less than two years, leaving technical debt as their lasting impact. They’re optimizing for short term stock prices, not for stability. For optics, not for innovation. The whole thing’s a house of cards. And he’s not sticking around to watch it fall.
